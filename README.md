# Antigravity Empower+

**Cognitive Governance & Orchestration Suite**

An agnostic framework designed to structure, validate, and empower autonomous agent reasoning. We transform chaotic execution into deterministic workflows via 'policy-as-code', enabling scalable cognitive operations across any complex domain—from academic research to enterprise software orchestration
